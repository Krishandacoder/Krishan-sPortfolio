    <h2 style="margin:auto;float:center;">I love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket">cricket</a> as it is my favorite sport. I am a batsmen allrounder which means that I can bowl, field, but I can do batting better.</h2>

    <p style="margin:auto;text-align:center;">I started cricket at the age of 6 when I used to play with my dad.</p>
    <p style="margin:auto;text-align:center;">Now I am in a club or team where we play against other teams in tournaments.</p>
    <p style="margin:auto;text-align:center;">Fun Fact: I have played in a national tournament and there I got 2 MVPs. Sadly, our team was not able to be in 1st place at the end of the tournament.</p>

    <h1>My most recent cricket tournament</h1>
    <p style="margin:auto;text-align:center;">In another most recent national cricket tournament that took place a few days ago, I made many runs, took many wickets, and got 1 MVP trophy but our team again was not able to top 1st in the end of the event.</p>
